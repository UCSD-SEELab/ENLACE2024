The project is missing several folders where the data should be stored in. For the scripts to work, 
add three folders named "uploaded_data", "unpacked_data", and "csvs", each one of them with folders 
for the subject, which should be named "subject_(subject number)". The subject folders in 
"uploaded_data" should then be filled with the data folder named after the uuid of each subject. 
For example, the directory should be named:

"C:\Users\John\Desktop\projects\ESS_test\uploaded_data\subject_1\6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0b
